# Introduction to Binary Search Tree


## What is Binary Search Tree?

**Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a special type of **binary tree** in which the **left child** of a node has a value **less** than the node’s value and the **right child** has a value **greater** than the node’s value. This property is called the **BST** property and it makes it possible to **efficiently search, insert, and delete** elements in the tree.

## Properties of Binary Search Tree:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values lesser than the node’s value.

* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node’s value.

* This means everything to the left of the root is less than the value of the root and everything to the right of the root is greater than the value of the root. Due to this performing, a binary search is very easy.

* The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
