## Applications of Sorting


* **Searching Algorithms:** Sorting is often a crucial step in search algorithms like binary search, Ternary Search, where the data needs to be sorted before searching for a specific element.

* **Data management:** Sorting data makes it easier to search, retrieve, and analyze.

* **Database optimization:** Sorting data in databases improves query performance.

* **Machine learning:** Sorting is used to prepare data for training machine learning models.

* **Operating Systems:** Sorting algorithms are used in operating systems for tasks like task scheduling, memory management, and file system organization.
