* Both **Lower Bound** and **Upper Bound** is very important. ðŸ¥‡ ðŸ¥‡


??? tip "Implement Lower Bound"


    ---

    **What is Lower Bound?**

    * The lower bound algorithm finds the **first or the smallest index** in a sorted array where the **value** at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.

    * The lower bound is the smallest index, ind, where arr[ind] >= x. But **if any such index is not found**, the lower bound algorithm returns n i.e. size of the given array.

    ```cpp

    
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>
    using namespace std;

    int lowerBound(vector<int> arr, int n, int x) {
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        int ans = n;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            // maybe an answer
            if (arr[mid] >= x) {
                ans = mid;
                //look for smaller index on the left
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                low = mid + 1; // look on the right
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    int main(){

        vector<int> arr = {3, 5, 8, 15, 19};
        int n = 5, x = 9;
        int ind = lowerBound(arr, n, x);
        cout << "The lower bound is the index: " << ind << "\n";

        return 0;
    }


    ```


??? tip "Implement Upper Bound"

    **What is Upper Bound?**

    * The upper bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than the given key i.e. x.

    * The upper bound is the smallest index, where arr[ind] > x.

    * But **if any such index is not found**, the upper bound algorithm returns n i.e. size of the given array. The main **difference between** the lower and upper bound is in the condition. **For the lower bound the condition was arr[ind] >= x** and here, **in the case of the upper bound, it is arr[ind] > x**.

    ```cpp

    #include <bits/stdc++.h>
    using namespace std;

    int upperBound(vector<int> &arr, int x, int n) {
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        int ans = n;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            // maybe an answer
            if (arr[mid] > x) {
                ans = mid;
                //look for smaller index on the left
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                low = mid + 1; // look on the right
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    int main(){

        vector<int> arr = {3, 5, 8, 9, 15, 19};
        int n = 6, x = 9;
        int ind = upperBound(arr, x, n);
        cout << "The upper bound is the index: " << ind << "\n";

        return 0;
    }


    ```
