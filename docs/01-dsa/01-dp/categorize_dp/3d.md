# 3-D Dynamic Programming

We defined sub-problems and their dependency, other important entities in **dp** are the **dependent elements or variables**. The **count** of these variables defines the **dimension** of the problem. If a problem is dependent on **3** variable, its a **3D dp** problem.

🧠 👍 Out of bound **base cases** should be written at the **top** of **all** of the base cases.

    **Steps to form the recursive solution :-**

    **Base Case:**

    * If j1<0 or j1>=M or j2<0 or j2>=M  , then we return -1e9 

    * When i == N-1, it means we are at the last row, so we need to return from here. Now it can happen that at the last row, both Alice and Bob are at the same cell, in this condition we will return only chocolates collected by Alice, mat[i][j1] ( as question states that the chocolates cannot be doubly calculated), otherwise we return sum of chocolates collected by both, mat[i][j1] + mat[i][j1][j2].

    ```cpp

    if(j1 < 0 || j1 >= m || j2 >= m || j2 < 0){
        return -1e9;
    }
    if(i == n-1){
        if(j1 == j2){
            return grid[i][j1];
        }
        else{
            return grid[i][j1] + grid[i][j2];
        }
    }

    ```


    **Step 2:** Try out all possible choices at a given index.

    * we need to understand that we want to move Alice and Bob together. Both of them can individually move three moves but say Alice moves to bottom-left, then Bob can have three different moves for Alice’s move, and so on.

    * Hence we have a total of 9 different options at every f(i,j1,j2) to move Alice and Bob. Now we can manually write these 9 options or we can observe a pattern in them, first Alice moves to one side and Bob tries all three choices, then again Alice moves, then Bob, and so on. This pattern can be easily captured by using two nested loops that change the column numbers(j1 and j2).

    * **Note:** if (j1===j2), as discussed in the base case, we will only consider chocolates collected by one of them otherwise we will consider chocolates collected by both of them.


    **Step 3:**  Take the maximum of all choices

    ```cpp

    int maxi = INT_MIN;
    for(int p = -1 ; p <= 1 ; p++){
        for(int q = -1 ; q <= 1 ; q++){
            int ans;
                    
            if(j1 == j2){
                ans = grid[i][j1];
            }
            else{
                ans = grid[i][j1]+ grid[i][j2];
            }
            ans += solver(i+1 , j1+p , j2+q , n , m , grid , dp);
                    
            maxi = max(maxi , ans);
        }
    }

    ```

                return dp[i][j1][j2];
            }

                    maxi = max(maxi , ans);
                }
            }
            return dp[i][j1][j2] = maxi;

        int solve(int n, int m, vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
            
            vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n , vector<vector<int>>(m , vector<int>(m , -1)));
            return solver(0 , 0 , m-1 , n , m , grid , dp);
