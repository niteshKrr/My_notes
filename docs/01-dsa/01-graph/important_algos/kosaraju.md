## Strongly Connected Components - Kosaraju's Algorithm

A component is called a Strongly Connected Component(SCC) only if for every possible pair of vertices (u, v) inside that component, u is reachable from v and v is reachable from u.

* Strongly Connected Components are only valid for directed graph.
