## What is a Linked List?

A **linked list** is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers. Each node contains **data** and a **reference** to the next node in the list.<br>

Unlike **arrays**, linked lists allow for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the list, as the nodes are **not** stored contiguously in memory.
