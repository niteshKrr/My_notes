# Different STORAGES used in Computers

## Memory Hierarchy

![loading...](../../images/operating_system/imp_to_know/MemoryHierarchy.png)


- **Register:** Smallest unit of storage. It is a part of CPU itself.
    - A register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any data (such as bit sequence or individual characters).
    - Registers are a type of computer memory used to quickly accept, store, and transfer data and instructions that are being used immediately by the CPU.

2. **Cache:** Additional memory system that temporarily stores frequently used instructions and data for quicker processing by the CPU.

3. **Main Memory: `RAM`**.
4. **Secondary Memory:** Storage media, on which computer can store data & programs.

## Comparison ðŸ¤º

1. **Cost:**
    - Primary storages are costly.
    - Registers are most expensive due to expensive semiconductors & labour.
    - Secondary storages are cheaper than primary.

2. **Access Speed:**
    - Primary has higher access speed than secondary memory.
    - Registers has highest access speed, then comes cache, then main memory.

3. **Storage size:**
    - Secondary has more space.

4. **Volatility:**
    - Primary memory is volatile. **`(Data is lost when power is turned off.)`**
    - Secondary is non-volatile. `(Data is retained even when power is turned off.)`
