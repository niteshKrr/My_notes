# Batch Operating System


## Batch Operating System

**In the 1970s**, Batch processing was very popular.In batch processing, the operating system (OS) groups or batches together jobs of a similar type or nature for execution. This method is common in environments where a large number of jobs need to be processed, such as in early **mainframe computers or modern-day high-performance computing**.

The main idea behind batch processing is to collect jobs with similar requirements (like CPU-bound jobs, I/O-bound jobs, or those that require similar types of resources) and execute them together. This grouping allows the OS to manage resources more efficiently, reduce the idle time of the CPU, and ensure that all jobs get the necessary system resources.

## Key features of OS

* **Job grouping:** Similar types of jobs are batched together, typically based on their nature or resource requirements.

* **Automatic job execution:** Once submitted, the jobs are executed automatically by the OS without manual intervention.

* **Efficiency:** By grouping similar tasks, the OS can optimize resource usage, such as CPU and I/O devices, improving throughput.

* **Queueing system:** Jobs are queued up in the batch, and the OS executes them sequentially or in parallel (in modern systems).


## Advantages of Batch OS

!!! tip ""

    * Multiple users can share the batch systems.
    * The idle time for the batch system is very less.
    * It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems.



## Disadvantages of Batch OS

!!! danger ""

    * Batch systems are hard to debug.
    * It is sometimes costly.
    * The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails.
    * There are five jobs **J1, J2, J3, J4, and J5,** present in the batch. If the execution time of **J1** is very high, then the other four jobs will never be executed, or they will have to wait for a very long time. Hence the other processes get **starved**.

**In traditional batch processing systems, the process of batching jobs was typically done by a system administrator or a job scheduler. Here's how it usually worked:**

1. **System Administrator or Operator (Manual Batching):**

In early computing systems, operators would manually collect jobs submitted by users (such as punched cards or submitted scripts). These jobs were then grouped or "batched" together based on their resource requirements or processing characteristics (such as CPU-bound or I/O-bound). The administrator would then feed these batches into the system for processing.

2. **Job Scheduler (Automated Batching):**

In more advanced systems, the operating system's job scheduler automatically handled the batching process. Users would submit their jobs, and the job scheduler would analyze the requirements of each job (such as memory, CPU, and I/O needs) and group similar jobs together into batches. These batches would be executed sequentially or in parallel, depending on system capabilities and job priority.


Modern operating systems, especially in environments like high-performance computing (HPC) or distributed systems, use batch job scheduling systems like:

* **SLURM** (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management)
* **PBS** (Portable Batch System)
* **IBM's LoadLeveler**
