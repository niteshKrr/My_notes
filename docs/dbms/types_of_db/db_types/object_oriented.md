# Object Oriented Databases

## Object Oriented Databases

!!! info ""
    1. The object-oriented data model, is based on the object-oriented-programming paradigm, which is now in wide use.
    Inheritance, object-identity, and encapsulation (information hiding), with methods to provide an interface to objects, are among the key concepts of object-oriented programming that have found applications in data modelling. The object-oriented data model also supports a rich type system, including structured and collection types. While inheritance and, to some extent, complex types are also present in the E-R model, encapsulation and object-identity distinguish the object-oriented data model from the E-R model.
    2. Sometimes the database can be very complex, having multiple relations. So, maintaining a relationship between them can be tedious at times.
        - In Object-oriented databases data is treated as an object.
        - All bits of information come in one instantly available object package instead of multiple tables.



!!! success "Advantages"
    - Data storage and retrieval is easy and quick.
    - Can handle complex data relations and more variety of data types that standard relational databases.
    - Relatively friendly to model the advance real world problems
    - Works with functionality of OOPs and Object Oriented languages.



!!! bug "Disadvantages"
    - High complexity causes performance issues like read, write, update and delete operations are slowed down.
    - Not much of a community support as isnâ€™t widely adopted as relational databases.
    - Does not support views like relational databases.
    - e.g., `ObjectDB`, `GemStone` etc.
